//📘 CAPS Offline EdTech Platform

Command-Prompt-Driven | Tablet-Integrated | CAPS-Aligned

Project Overview:

This repository contains the first working prototype of a South African CAPS-aligned offline-first EdTech platform, designed to run on entry-level Android tablets distributed to schools, learners, and education stakeholders.

The platform is being developed using an AI-assisted, command-prompt-driven workflow (“vibe coding”), where system behaviour, curriculum structure, UI/UX, and learning logic are defined deterministically via structured prompts, then implemented into functional web and application components.

This approach allows rapid iteration, clear curriculum alignment, and cost-effective development while maintaining full architectural control.

🎯 Purpose & Vision

The goal of this application is to:

Support Grades R–12 learners in alignment with the CAPS curriculum

Operate offline-first on tablets distributed to learners

Enable subscription-based access per grade

Provide progress tracking for parents, teachers, and schools

Generate term completion certificates (PDF)

Integrate seamlessly with tablet hardware sold by Diamond Umbrella Devs

The application is intended to be preloaded or deployed on tablets supplied to:

Schools

Wholesalers

NGOs / NPOs

Education programmes

Parents (direct purchase)

🧠 Development Approach (Vibe Coding / Command Prompts)

This project is intentionally built using a prompt-first engineering methodology, where:

Curriculum logic is defined before UI

CAPS structure drives data models

Lessons, activities, and assessments are generated from explicit prompts

The AI agent acts as a coding assistant, not a decision-maker

All outputs are deterministic, not probabilistic

This ensures:

Predictable learning outcomes

Audit-friendly logic (important for DoE & schools)

Faster prototyping without sacrificing structure

Think of this as software architecture written in English first, then compiled into code.

📱 Tablet Integration Strategy

This platform is being developed specifically for tablet deployment, not just browsers.

Planned Tablet Model

Entry-level Android tablets

Offline content storage

Periodic sync when internet is available

Locked grade access via license/subscription

Tablet Use Cases
Client Type	Tablet Use
Schools	Classroom + homework learning
Wholesalers	Hardware only or bundled
NGOs	Education support kits
Parents	Home learning//
Government	Intervention & pilot programmes

The tablet remains a physical product sale, while the software operates on a subscription model per learner grade.
